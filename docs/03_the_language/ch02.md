# Variables

Variables are places that store values. There are three kinds of
variables in Lua: global variables, local variables, and table fields.

A single name can denote a global variable or a local variable (or a
function\'s formal parameter, which is a particular kind of local
variable):

        var ::= Name

Name denotes identifiers (see [Lexical Conventions](/03_the_language/ch01#lexical-conventions)).

Any variable name is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared as
a local (see [Local Declarations](/03_the_language/ch03#local-declarations)). Local variables are *lexically scoped*:
local variables can be freely accessed by functions defined inside their
scope (see [Visibility Rules](/03_the_language/ch05#visibility-rules)).

Before the first assignment to a variable, its value is **nil**.

Square brackets are used to index a table:

        var ::= prefixexp ‘[’ exp ‘]’

The meaning of accesses to table fields can be changed via metatables
(see [Metatables and Metamethods](/02_basic_concepts/ch04#metatables-and-metamethods)).

The syntax `var.Name` is just syntactic sugar for `var["Name"]`:

        var ::= prefixexp ‘.’ Name

An access to a global variable `x` is equivalent to `_ENV.x`. Due to the
way that chunks are compiled, the variable `_ENV` itself is never global
(see [Environments and the Global Environment](/02_basic_concepts/ch02#environments-and-the-global-environment)).
