# The Language

This section describes the lexis, the syntax, and the semantics of Lua.
In other words, this section describes which tokens are valid, how they
can be combined, and what their combinations mean.

Language constructs will be explained using the usual extended BNF
notation, in which {*a*} means 0 or more *a*\'s, and \[*a*\] means an
optional *a*. Non-terminals are shown like non-terminal, keywords are
shown like **kword**, and other terminal symbols are shown like '**=**'.
The complete syntax of Lua can be found in [§9](#9) at the end of this
manual.
