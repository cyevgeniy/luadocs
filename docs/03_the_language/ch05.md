# Visibility Rules

Lua is a lexically scoped language. The scope of a local variable begins
at the first statement after its declaration and lasts until the last
non-void statement of the innermost block that includes the declaration.
Consider the following example:

         x = 10                -- global variable
         do                    -- new block
           local x = x         -- new 'x', with value 10
           print(x)            --> 10
           x = x+1
           do                  -- another block
             local x = x+1     -- another 'x'
             print(x)          --> 12
           end
           print(x)            --> 11
         end
         print(x)              --> 10  (the global one)

Notice that, in a declaration like `local x = x`, the new `x` being
declared is not in scope yet, and so the second `x` refers to the
outside variable.

Because of the lexical scoping rules, local variables can be freely
accessed by functions defined inside their scope. A local variable used
by an inner function is called an *upvalue* (or *external local
variable*, or simply *external variable*) inside the inner function.

Notice that each execution of a **local** statement defines new local
variables. Consider the following example:

         a = {}
         local x = 20
         for i = 1, 10 do
           local y = 0
           a[i] = function () y = y + 1; return x + y end
         end

The loop creates ten closures (that is, ten instances of the anonymous
function). Each of these closures uses a different `y` variable, while
all of them share the same `x`.
