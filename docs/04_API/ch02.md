# C Closures

When a C function is created, it is possible to associate some values
with it, thus creating a *C closure* (see
[`lua_pushcclosure`](#lua_pushcclosure)); these values are called
*upvalues* and are accessible to the function whenever it is called.

Whenever a C function is called, its upvalues are located at specific
pseudo-indices. These pseudo-indices are produced by the macro
[`lua_upvalueindex`](#lua_upvalueindex). The first upvalue associated
with a function is at index `lua_upvalueindex(1)`, and so on. Any access
to `lua_upvalueindex(`*`n`*`)`, where *n* is greater than the number of
upvalues of the current function (but not greater than 256, which is one
plus the maximum number of upvalues in a closure), produces an
acceptable but invalid index.

A C closure can also change the values of its corresponding upvalues.
