# Registry

Lua provides a *registry*, a predefined table that can be used by any
C code to store whatever Lua values it needs to store. The registry
table is always accessible at pseudo-index
[`LUA_REGISTRYINDEX`]{#pdf-LUA_REGISTRYINDEX}. Any C library can store
data into this table, but it must take care to choose keys that are
different from those used by other libraries, to avoid collisions.
Typically, you should use as key a string containing your library name,
or a light userdata with the address of a C object in your code, or any
Lua object created by your code. As with variable names, string keys
starting with an underscore followed by uppercase letters are reserved
for Lua.

The integer keys in the registry are used by the reference mechanism
(see [`luaL_ref`]( /05_aux_lib/ch01#lual-ref)) and by some predefined values. Therefore,
integer keys in the registry must not be used for other purposes.

When you create a new Lua state, its registry comes with some predefined
values. These predefined values are indexed with integer keys defined as
constants in `lua.h`. The following constants are defined:

-   **[`LUA_RIDX_MAINTHREAD`]{#pdf-LUA_RIDX_MAINTHREAD}:** At this index
    the registry has the main thread of the state. (The main thread is
    the one created together with the state.)
-   **[`LUA_RIDX_GLOBALS`]{#pdf-LUA_RIDX_GLOBALS}:** At this index the
    registry has the global environment.
