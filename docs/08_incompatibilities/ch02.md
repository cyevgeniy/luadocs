## 8.2 -- [Incompatibilities in the Libraries]{#8.2}

-   The function [`print`]( /06_standard_lib/ch01#print-···) does not call
    [`tostring`]( /06_standard_lib/ch01#tostring-v) to format its arguments; instead, it has
    this functionality hardwired. You should use `__tostring` to modify
    how values are printed.
-   The pseudo-random number generator used by the function
    [`math.random`]( /06_standard_lib/ch07#math-random-m-n) now starts with a somewhat random
    seed. Moreover, it uses a different algorithm.
-   By default, the decoding functions in the [`utf8`](#pdf-utf8)
    library do not accept surrogates as valid code points. An extra
    parameter in these functions makes them more permissive.
-   The options \"`setpause`\" and \"`setstepmul`\" of the function
    [`collectgarbage`]( /06_standard_lib/ch01#collectgarbage-opt-arg) are deprecated. You should
    use the new option \"`incremental`\" to set them.
-   The function [`io.lines`]( /06_standard_lib/ch08#io-lines-filename-···) now returns four values,
    instead of just one. That can be a problem when it is used as the
    sole argument to another function that has optional parameters, such
    as in `load(io.lines(filename, "L"))`. To fix that issue, you can
    wrap the call into parentheses, to adjust its number of results to
    one.
