## Incompatibilities in the API

-   Full userdata now has an arbitrary number of associated user values.
    Therefore, the functions `lua_newuserdata`, `lua_setuservalue`, and
    `lua_getuservalue` were replaced by
    [`lua_newuserdatauv`]( /04_API/ch06#lua-newuserdatauv),
    [`lua_setiuservalue`]( /04_API/ch06#lua-setiuservalue), and
    [`lua_getiuservalue`]( /04_API/ch06#lua-getiuservalue), which have an extra
    argument.

    For compatibility, the old names still work as macros assuming one
    single user value. Note, however, that userdata with zero user
    values are more efficient memory-wise.

-   The function [`lua_resume`]( /04_API/ch06#lua-resume) has an extra parameter.
    This out parameter returns the number of values on the top of the
    stack that were yielded or returned by the coroutine. (In previous
    versions, those values were the entire stack.)

-   The function [`lua_version`]( /04_API/ch06#lua-version) returns the version
    number, instead of an address of the version number. The Lua core
    should work correctly with libraries using their own static copies
    of the same core, so there is no need to check whether they are
    using the same address space.

-   The constant `LUA_ERRGCMM` was removed. Errors in finalizers are
    never propagated; instead, they generate a warning.

-   The options `LUA_GCSETPAUSE` and `LUA_GCSETSTEPMUL` of the function
    [`lua_gc`]( /04_API/ch06#lua-gc) are deprecated. You should use the new option
    `LUA_GCINC` to set them.
