# Incompatibilities in the Language

-   The coercion of strings to numbers in arithmetic and bitwise
    operations has been removed from the core language. The string
    library does a similar job for arithmetic (but not for bitwise)
    operations using the string metamethods. However, unlike in previous
    versions, the new implementation preserves the implicit type of the
    numeral in the string. For instance, the result of `"1" + "2"` now
    is an integer, not a float.
-   Literal decimal integer constants that overflow are read as floats,
    instead of wrapping around. You can use hexadecimal notation for
    such constants if you want the old behavior (reading them as
    integers with wrap around).
-   The use of the `__lt` metamethod to emulate `__le` has been removed.
    When needed, this metamethod must be explicitly defined.
-   The semantics of the numerical **for** loop over integers changed in
    some details. In particular, the control variable never wraps
    around.
-   A label for a **goto** cannot be declared where a label with the
    same name is visible, even if this other label is declared in an
    enclosing block.
-   When finalizing an object, Lua does not ignore `__gc` metamethods
    that are not functions. Any value will be called, if present.
    (Non-callable values will generate a warning, like any other error
    when calling a finalizer.)
