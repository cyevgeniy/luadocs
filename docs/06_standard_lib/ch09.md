# Operating System Facilities

This library is implemented through table [`os`]{#pdf-os}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `os.clock ()`

Returns an approximation of the amount in seconds of CPU time used by
the program, as returned by the underlying ISO C function `clock`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `os.date ([format [, time]])`

Returns a string or a table containing date and time, formatted
according to the given string `format`.

If the `time` argument is present, this is the time to be formatted (see
the [`os.time`]( /06_standard_lib/ch095#os-time-table) function for a description of this value).
Otherwise, `date` formats the current time.

If `format` starts with \'`!`\', then the date is formatted in
Coordinated Universal Time. After this optional character, if `format`
is the string \"`*t`\", then `date` returns a table with the following
fields: `year`, `month` (1--12), `day` (1--31), `hour` (0--23), `min`
(0--59), `sec` (0--61, due to leap seconds), `wday` (weekday, 1--7,
Sunday is 1), `yday` (day of the year, 1--366), and `isdst` (daylight
saving flag, a boolean). This last field may be absent if the
information is not available.

If `format` is not \"`*t`\", then `date` returns the date as a string,
formatted according to the same rules as the ISO C function `strftime`.

If `format` is absent, it defaults to \"`%c`\", which gives a
human-readable date and time representation using the current locale.

On non-POSIX systems, this function may be not thread safe because of
its reliance on C function `gmtime` and C function `localtime`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `os.difftime (t2, t1)`

Returns the difference, in seconds, from time `t1` to time `t2` (where
the times are values returned by [`os.time`]( /06_standard_lib/ch095#os-time-table)). In POSIX,
Windows, and some other systems, this value is exactly `t2`*-*`t1`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `os.execute ([command])`

This function is equivalent to the ISO C function `system`. It passes
`command` to be executed by an operating system shell. Its first result
is **true** if the command terminated successfully, or **fail**
otherwise. After this first result the function returns a string plus a
number, as follows:

-   **\"`exit`\":** the command terminated normally; the following
    number is the exit status of the command.
-   **\"`signal`\":** the command was terminated by a signal; the
    following number is the signal that terminated the command.

When called without a `command`, `os.execute` returns a boolean that is
true if a shell is available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `os.exit ([code [, close]])`

Calls the ISO C function `exit` to terminate the host program. If `code`
is **true**, the returned status is `EXIT_SUCCESS`; if `code` is
**false**, the returned status is `EXIT_FAILURE`; if `code` is a number,
the returned status is this number. The default value for `code` is
**true**.

If the optional second argument `close` is true, closes the Lua state
before exiting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `os.getenv (varname)`

Returns the value of the process environment variable `varname` or
**fail** if the variable is not defined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `os.remove (filename)`

Deletes the file (or empty directory, on POSIX systems) with the given
name. If this function fails, it returns **fail** plus a string
describing the error and the error code. Otherwise, it returns true.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `os.rename (oldname, newname)`

Renames the file or directory named `oldname` to `newname`. If this
function fails, it returns **fail**, plus a string describing the error
and the error code. Otherwise, it returns true.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `os.setlocale (locale [, category])`

Sets the current locale of the program. `locale` is a system-dependent
string specifying a locale; `category` is an optional string describing
which category to change: `"all"`, `"collate"`, `"ctype"`, `"monetary"`,
`"numeric"`, or `"time"`; the default category is `"all"`. The function
returns the name of the new locale, or **fail** if the request cannot be
honored.

If `locale` is the empty string, the current locale is set to an
implementation-defined native locale. If `locale` is the string \"`C`\",
the current locale is set to the standard C locale.

When called with **nil** as the first argument, this function only
returns the name of the current locale for the given category.

This function may be not thread safe because of its reliance on
C function `setlocale`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `os.time ([table])`

Returns the current time when called without arguments, or a time
representing the local date and time specified by the given table. This
table must have fields `year`, `month`, and `day`, and may have fields
`hour` (default is 12), `min` (default is 0), `sec` (default is 0), and
`isdst` (default is **nil**). Other fields are ignored. For a
description of these fields, see the [`os.date`]( /06_standard_lib/ch09#os-date-format-time) function.

When the function is called, the values in these fields do not need to
be inside their valid ranges. For instance, if `sec` is -10, it means 10
seconds before the time specified by the other fields; if `hour` is
1000, it means 1000 hours after the time specified by the other fields.

The returned value is a number, whose meaning depends on your system. In
POSIX, Windows, and some other systems, this number counts the number of
seconds since some given start time (the \"epoch\"). In other systems,
the meaning is not specified, and the number returned by `time` can be
used only as an argument to [`os.date`]( /06_standard_lib/ch09#os-date-format-time) and
[`os.difftime`]( /06_standard_lib/ch09#os-difftime-t2-t1).

When called with a table, `os.time` also normalizes all the fields
documented in the [`os.date`]( /06_standard_lib/ch09#os-date-format-time) function, so that they
represent the same time as before the call but with values inside their
valid ranges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `os.tmpname ()`

Returns a string with a file name that can be used for a temporary file.
The file must be explicitly opened before its use and explicitly removed
when no longer needed.

In POSIX systems, this function also creates a file with that name, to
avoid security risks. (Someone else might create the file with wrong
permissions in the time between getting the name and creating the file.)
You still have to open the file to use it and to remove it (even if you
do not use it).

When possible, you may prefer to use [`io.tmpfile`]( /06_standard_lib/ch085#io-tmpfile),
which automatically removes the file when the program ends.
