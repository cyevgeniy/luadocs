# Input and Output Facilities

The I/O library provides two different styles for file manipulation. The
first one uses implicit file handles; that is, there are operations to
set a default input file and a default output file, and all input/output
operations are done over these default files. The second style uses
explicit file handles.

When using implicit file handles, all operations are supplied by table
[`io`]{#pdf-io}. When using explicit file handles, the operation
[`io.open`]( /06_standard_lib/ch08#io-open-filename-mode) returns a file handle and then all operations
are supplied as methods of the file handle.

The metatable for file handles provides metamethods for `__gc` and
`__close` that try to close the file when called.

The table `io` also provides three predefined file handles with their
usual meanings from C: [`io.stdin`]{#pdf-io.stdin},
[`io.stdout`]{#pdf-io.stdout}, and [`io.stderr`]{#pdf-io.stderr}. The
I/O library never closes these files.

Unless otherwise stated, all I/O functions return **fail** on failure,
plus an error message as a second result and a system-dependent error
code as a third result, and some non-false value on success. On
non-POSIX systems, the computation of the error message and error code
in case of errors may be not thread safe, because they rely on the
global C variable `errno`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `io.close ([file])`

Equivalent to `file:close()`. Without a `file`, closes the default
output file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `io.flush ()`

Equivalent to `io.output():flush()`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `io.input ([file])`

When called with a file name, it opens the named file (in text mode),
and sets its handle as the default input file. When called with a file
handle, it simply sets this file handle as the default input file. When
called without arguments, it returns the current default input file.

In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning
an error code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `io.lines ([filename, ···])`

Opens the given file name in read mode and returns an iterator function
that works like `file:lines(···)` over the opened file. When the
iterator function fails to read any value, it automatically closes the
file. Besides the iterator function, `io.lines` returns three other
values: two **nil** values as placeholders, plus the created file
handle. Therefore, when used in a generic **for** loop, the file is
closed also if the loop is interrupted by an error or a **break**.

The call `io.lines()` (with no file name) is equivalent to
`io.input():lines("l")`; that is, it iterates over the lines of the
default input file. In this case, the iterator does not close the file
when the loop ends.

In case of errors opening the file, this function raises the error,
instead of returning an error code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `io.open (filename [, mode])`

This function opens a file, in the mode specified in the string `mode`.
In case of success, it returns a new file handle.

The `mode` string can be any of the following:

-   **\"`r`\":** read mode (the default);
-   **\"`w`\":** write mode;
-   **\"`a`\":** append mode;
-   **\"`r+`\":** update mode, all previous data is preserved;
-   **\"`w+`\":** update mode, all previous data is erased;
-   **\"`a+`\":** append update mode, previous data is preserved,
    writing is only allowed at the end of file.

The `mode` string can also have a \'`b`\' at the end, which is needed in
some systems to open the file in binary mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `io.output ([file])`

Similar to [`io.input`]( /06_standard_lib/ch08#io-input-file), but operates over the default
output file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `io.popen (prog [, mode])`

This function is system dependent and is not available on all platforms.

Starts the program `prog` in a separated process and returns a file
handle that you can use to read data from this program (if `mode` is
`"r"`, the default) or to write data to this program (if `mode` is
`"w"`).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `io.read (···)`

Equivalent to `io.input():read(···)`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `io.tmpfile ()`

In case of success, returns a handle for a temporary file. This file is
opened in update mode and it is automatically removed when the program
ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `io.type (obj)`

Checks whether `obj` is a valid file handle. Returns the string `"file"`
if `obj` is an open file handle, `"closed file"` if `obj` is a closed
file handle, or **fail** if `obj` is not a file handle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `io.write (···)`

Equivalent to `io.output():write(···)`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `file:close ()`

Closes `file`. Note that files are automatically closed when their
handles are garbage collected, but that takes an unpredictable amount of
time to happen.

When closing a file handle created with [`io.popen`]( /06_standard_lib/ch085#io-popen-prog-mode),
[`file:close`]( /06_standard_lib/ch085#file-close) returns the same values returned by
[`os.execute`]( /06_standard_lib/ch09#os-execute-command).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `file:flush ()`

Saves any written data to `file`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `file:lines (···)`

Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, reads the
file according to the given formats. When no format is given, uses
\"`l`\" as a default. As an example, the construction

         for c in file:lines(1) do body end

will iterate over all characters of the file, starting at the current
position. Unlike [`io.lines`]( /06_standard_lib/ch08#io-lines-filename-···), this function does not
close the file when the loop ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `file:read (···)`

Reads the file `file`, according to the given formats, which specify
what to read. For each format, the function returns a string or a number
with the characters read, or **fail** if it cannot read data with the
specified format. (In this latter case, the function does not read
subsequent formats.) When called without arguments, it uses a default
format that reads the next line (see below).

The available formats are

-   **\"`n`\":** reads a numeral and returns it as a float or an
    integer, following the lexical conventions of Lua. (The numeral may
    have leading whitespaces and a sign.) This format always reads the
    longest input sequence that is a valid prefix for a numeral; if that
    prefix does not form a valid numeral (e.g., an empty string,
    \"`0x`\", or \"`3.4e-`\") or it is too long (more than 200
    characters), it is discarded and the format returns **fail**.
-   **\"`a`\":** reads the whole file, starting at the current position.
    On end of file, it returns the empty string; this format never
    fails.
-   **\"`l`\":** reads the next line skipping the end of line, returning
    **fail** on end of file. This is the default format.
-   **\"`L`\":** reads the next line keeping the end-of-line character
    (if present), returning **fail** on end of file.
-   ***number*:** reads a string with up to this number of bytes,
    returning **fail** on end of file. If `number` is zero, it reads
    nothing and returns an empty string, or **fail** on end of file.

The formats \"`l`\" and \"`L`\" should be used only for text files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `file:seek ([whence [, offset]])`

Sets and gets the file position, measured from the beginning of the
file, to the position given by `offset` plus a base specified by the
string `whence`, as follows:

-   **\"`set`\":** base is position 0 (beginning of the file);
-   **\"`cur`\":** base is current position;
-   **\"`end`\":** base is end of file;

In case of success, `seek` returns the final file position, measured in
bytes from the beginning of the file. If `seek` fails, it returns
**fail**, plus a string describing the error.

The default value for `whence` is `"cur"`, and for `offset` is 0.
Therefore, the call `file:seek()` returns the current file position,
without changing it; the call `file:seek("set")` sets the position to
the beginning of the file (and returns 0); and the call
`file:seek("end")` sets the position to the end of the file, and returns
its size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `file:setvbuf (mode [, size])`

Sets the buffering mode for a file. There are three available modes:

-   **\"`no`\":** no buffering.
-   **\"`full`\":** full buffering.
-   **\"`line`\":** line buffering.

For the last two cases, `size` is a hint for the size of the buffer, in
bytes. The default is an appropriate size.

The specific behavior of each mode is non portable; check the underlying
ISO C function `setvbuf` in your platform for more details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `file:write (···)`

Writes the value of each of its arguments to `file`. The arguments must
be strings or numbers.

In case of success, this function returns `file`.
